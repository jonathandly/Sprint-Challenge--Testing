1. In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?

describe() splits your test suite into components. it() is used to perform individual tests and assertions. Describe is used to group tests together into a single suite and it is used to test things individually.

2. What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?

Testing reduces the number of bugs going into production, forces us to consider edge cases, minimizes regressions, and provides documentation for our code. While I understand the importance of testing, initially testing felt cumbersome and annoying. While it is more work upfront, it is less work longterm because it allows us to find bugs quicker and thus prevents having to debug difficult to find bugs later on. At first I was turned off on testing, it felt repetitive and wasn't as appealing as just writing code like we normally do. Testing requires you to think about your code differently than I'm used to, but the benefits outweigh the cons. In conclusion I see testing as a necessary evil.

3. Mention three types of automated tests?

Unit tests, End-to-End tests, and Integration tests.
